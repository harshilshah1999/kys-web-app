# Description (Project still under development)
## This project aims to digitize the operations of an NGO by developing a web application. Currently, the NGO performs all tasks related to blood donation events and other activities manually, relying on paper-based processes. The goal of this project is to streamline and automate these processes, making the NGO more efficient and digitally-driven.

## Features
1. Event Management: The web application allows the NGO to create, manage, and promote various events such as blood donation drives, fundraisers, awareness campaigns, and volunteer activities.
2. Registration and Attendance: Users can register for events through the web application, providing necessary details and preferences. The system maintains a record of event attendees, simplifying attendance tracking and generating reports.
3. Volunteer Management: The NGO can manage volunteers, assign tasks, and track their contributions. Volunteers can sign up, view available opportunities, and update their availability or preferences.
4. Blood Donation Management: The web app provides a platform for managing blood donation events, including donor registration, scheduling appointments, tracking blood units collected, and sending notifications/reminders to donors.
5. Donor Database: A centralized database stores donor information, including contact details, blood type, donation history, and eligibility criteria. This database enables quick retrieval of donor information and facilitates targeted communication.
6. Reporting and Analytics: The system generates comprehensive reports and analytics, providing insights into event attendance, donor statistics, volunteer participation, and overall impact. These reports aid in decision-making and future planning.
7. Notifications and Communication: The web application incorporates a messaging system to send notifications, updates, and reminders to volunteers, donors, and event attendees.
8. Secure User Authentication: The system ensures secure user authentication and role-based access control to protect sensitive data and allow appropriate access to authorized personnel.
